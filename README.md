# Avi-On-Cooper-HaloHome-Setup-with-MQTT
This documentation goes through setting up any Halo Home lights that are no longer (discontinued) via their halo home API, cooper lighting, or avi-on devices to have Home Assistant see them using MQTT broker.

Referencing Oyvindkinsey (https://github.com/oyvindkinsey/avionmqtt) for initial work done to get this to work, along with his additional acknowledgements mentioned.

# Hardware/Software Requirements for using this setup
- The AVI-ON MQTT broker can be installed on any hardware as long as you are able to run linux OS.  There is no real limitation to what you need to run this service as long as you are meeting the OS standards to run the OS. Ultimate solutions would be a rasberry pi with wifi/bluetooth capabilities will work perfect for this use case.
- Bluetooth antenna device connected to your server to pickup your lights if you are not using a device such as a motherboard with an on-board bluetooth antenna.  Alternatively, you can easily purchase a USB bluetooth antenna for very cheap.
- Have your lights setup/configured without your Avi-On app via your smartphone to ensure you have your lights/devices added into your avi-on account.
- Home Assistant using HACS - This allows me to add the home assistant MQTT add-on needed to add devices into HA
- Mosquitto Broker within Home Assistant - There is nothing to configure than to ensure the ports are using the default ports.  I am using the MQTT broker for other purposes than just Avi-On, so there is no issue with using the broker for different use cases.

# Information about this guide and devices I am using for this guide
- VM running Linux Ubuntu version 24.04.2 Live Server
- VM has default configuration with basic cores, RAM, and HDD space allocated to operate the Ubuntu OS
- I did purchase a bluetooth antenna (ZEXMTE USB Bluetooth Adapter for PC, Long Range Bluetooth USB Adapter for Windows 11/10, 492FT/150M Bluetooth Dongle 5.1 EDR, Plug & Play for Desktop, Laptop, Printers, Mouse, Speakersâ€¦).  But as mentioned previously, any bluetooth adapter should work if you are in need of one.
- There was a lot of issues I ran into which I will try my best to capture the necessary commands to run through from begginging to end.

# Assumptions
- You have Home Assistant HACS installed on Home Assistant
- You have the Mosquitto Borker installed within your Home Assistant environment
- You have Ubuntu OS installed or similar OS installed on a server or device
- You have access to SSH to run commands within your Ubuntu OS

# Switch to Root & Install System Dependencies
Start by switching to the root user:
```bash
sudo su
```

Update your system and install essential tools
- python3 - the language AvionMQTT is written in
- mosquitto - this is the MQTT broker needed as the central server that devices (lights) will connect to
- nano - ensures you can easily edit the "settings.yaml" file later.
- libglib2.0-dev ensures Bluepy compiles successfully.
- pkg-config is required for dependency checks.
```bash
apt update
apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip git mosquitto mosquitto-clients bluez libglib2.0-dev pkg-config nano
```

# Clone AvionMQTT Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fusioncha0s/avionmqtt.git
cd avionmqtt
```

# Create & Activate a Virtual Environment
Setting up a Python virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated.
```bash
python3 -m venv avion-env
source avion-env/bin/activate
```

Automate the activation of the virtual environment to ensure updates to python code can still be done. This ensures that every time you start a new terminal session, the virtual environment is activated. If you open a new terminal/SSH connection to the server, the system defaults back to the global Python environment, which may not have the necessary dependencies for AvionMQTT.  This can be done manually everytime you SSH into your server, otherwise you can automate this using the below code.
- Change "YOUR_USERNAME" to your ubuntu profile name located under your home directory
```bash
echo "source /home/YOUR_USERNAME/avionmqtt/avion-env/bin/activate" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Apply the changes to the automation
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Install AvionMQTT Dependencies
```bash
pip install .
```

If for any reason "pip install ." errors, ensure bluepy is installed correctly by running the following command
```bash
pip install bluepy
```
If that also fails, you can manually build and install bluephy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy.git
cd bluepy
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install
```

# Create the Settings.yaml Configuration File
```bash
nano settings.yaml
```

Use the following configuration file.  Some things to note
## avion section
- Update "YOUREMAIL@google.com" with your avion email address, no parenthises needed
- Update "YOURPASSWORD" with your avion password, no parenthises needed
## mqtt section
- **Host:** Update "YOURIPOFYOURHOMEASSISTANTSERVER" with your home assistant service IP address, no parenthises needed
- **Ports:** No ports need to be defined unless you are using custom ports. If custom ports are used, uncomment the port section within the configuration and provide your port #.
- **Username** Update your username to the specified username you created within your Home Assistant server and which you are planning to use for your MQTT broker in Home Assistant.  Assuming your username is all one word.
- **Password** Update your password to the specified password you created within your Home Assistant server and which you are planning to use for your MQTT broker in Home Assistant.  **you do need to include parenthises around your password on this line**

## devices, groups, and capabilities_overrides
- I went with absolute basic with little testing into other arguments that can be added on these lines.  Devices and Groups section utilize brackets "[]" to ensure all devices and groups are added through the MQTT broker and into Home Assistant, I am not looking to limit devices with my setup, so this should obtain everything you have within your Avi-On app if you were to look at your app on your smartphone.  See the following code below the configuration file (Dimming and color temp ranges example) if you want to include dimming and color temp ranges within your configuration file.

```bash
avion:
  email: YOUREMAIL@google.com #Your avion email, you can confirm by opening the avi-on app on your smart device and review your p>
  password: YOURPASSWORD #Your avion password used in concjuction with your email

mqtt:
  host: YOURIPOFYOURHOMEASSISTANTSERVER #The IP of the mqtt broker that is installed on your Home Assistant server.  You do not need to include any port
  #port: YOUR_CUSTOM_PORT
  username: TESTUSER #The username of your mqtt broker on your Home Assistant server
  password: "YOURPASSWORD" #The password of your mqtt broker on your Home Assitant server

devices:
  import: true
  include: []  # Empty list means all devices are included
  exclude: []
  exclude_in_group: false

groups:
  import: true
  include: []
  exclude: []

single_device: true

capabilities_overrides:
  dimming: {} # This tells AvionMQTT that the device supports dimming, but no additional parameters are set.
  color_temp: {} # This indicates that the device supports color temperature adjustments, but no override values are provided.
```

Dimming and color temp ranges example
```bash
capabilities_overrides:
  dimming:
    min_brightness: 1
    max_brightness: 100
  color_temp:
    min_kelvin: 2700
    max_kelvin: 6500
```
